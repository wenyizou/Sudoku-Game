Sudoku Game(Have a try :D)

This is a Sudoku game I built from scratch in Java, including a GUI interface built with the Swing library. The game includes three difficultly levels, warns users when they input incorrect numbers with color, and additional features like a game timer, numbers remaining and hint. The algorithm used for solving the Sudoku problems uses hashmaps and dynamic programming. 

Sudoku.jar is the game, have a try :D
